v1.0.1 goals
- Make Demo 2 even SICKER
- Finish Method documentation (resetPosition);

TO DO:
> Implement custom easings
> Work around for box-shadow 1 pixel off
> Move getAttribute to array for array lookups YO!
> Be able to pass in just one ['left', 'right']
> Just passsing color options sets ALL colors
> Add sticky options for init ALSO zIndex
> Ability to flip directions of slices

KNOWN BUGS:
> Unreliable detect start of CSS animation
** PRETTY SURE I FIXED THIS IN v1.01 BUT NEEDS FURTHER TESTING
> QueuedAnimation is buggy when moving firing rapid goPhase()s.
