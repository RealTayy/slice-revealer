# Slice Revealer
Slice Revealer is a easy to use dependancy free library that allows users to cover and uncover images with customizable animated slices. The idea was inspired by [Zhenya Rynzhuk](https://zhenyary.com/) of [Sochnik](https://dribbble.com/Sochnik)'s [transition experiments](https://dribbble.com/shots/4132057-Selected-Works-Transitions-Experiments).
